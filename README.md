## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a variety of algorithm practice files implemented in various programming languages. Each algorithm has been carefully chosen to cover different problem-solving techniques, such as sorting, searching, graph algorithms, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before using the code in this repository, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Programming Language**: You should have a basic understanding of the programming language used in the algorithm files.
- **Development Environment**: Set up a suitable development environment for running and testing the algorithms.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-practice.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd algorithm-practice`
3. Choose the algorithm you want to practice and open the corresponding file in your preferred code editor.

## Usage

Each algorithm file is self-contained and can be run independently. Open the file in your chosen programming environment and follow the instructions within the code comments to execute the algorithm.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different inputs, and explore how the algorithm behaves in different scenarios.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have implemented an algorithm that you would like to share or have found a bug in the existing code, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-algorithm` or `bugfix/issue-description`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add new algorithm'` or `git commit -m 'Fix issue description'`.
4. Push the changes to your forked repository: `git push origin feature/new-algorithm` or `git push origin bugfix/issue-description`.
5. Submit a pull request explaining your changes.

Please ensure that your code follows the existing style and includes appropriate documentation and tests.
